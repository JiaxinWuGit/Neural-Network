# Neural-Network
This is a neural network built for number recognition, trained by data from MNIST.
We use 50,000 data set as training examples, and 10,000 for testing. The remaining 10,000 examples are reserved for hyper parameter experiments.

The main_NN.py code contains all the necessary functions to train and test the neural network. These functions can also be found under different Python files for future usage.

The .pkl file for parameters contains the best set of parameters which has been trained by main_NN.py so far. One can read and use them by the load_parameters function in export_import.py.


Accuracy Record = 97.61 %
